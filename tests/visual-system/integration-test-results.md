# Visual Customization System Integration Test Results

## Task 7: Test integration with existing components

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Requirements Tested:**
- Requirement 2.1: Custom colors work with existing Preline UI components
- Requirement 2.2: Tailwind utilities are generated correctly  
- Requirement 5.2: Theme switching works with HSThemeAppearance

## Test Implementation

### 1. Manual Testing Page
Created comprehensive integration test page at `/component-integration-test` that includes:

- **Modal Integration**: Login, Register, and Recover modals with custom styling
- **Navbar Integration**: Demo navbar showing custom color application
- **Footer Integration**: Footer component with custom colors
- **Theme Switching**: HSThemeAppearance integration testing

### 2. Automated Testing
Implemented automated integration tests that verify:

- **Tailwind Utility Generation**: CSS custom properties are correctly applied
- **Preline UI Integration**: Components use custom color classes
- **HSThemeAppearance Integration**: Theme switching system works
- **Existing Components Integration**: Navbar, modals, forms are properly integrated
