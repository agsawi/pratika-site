# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves replacing the existing template colors with Pratika's brand colors from their brand guide. The focus is on updating the color system while maintaining the existing template structure, content, and functionality. This is a color replacement that will establish Pratika's brand presence through their color palette without modifying any other aspects of the site.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see Pratika's brand colors used throughout the site instead of the template's default colors, so that the site reflects Pratika's brand identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit any page THEN the system SHALL display Pratika's brand colors wherever the template currently uses its color system
2. WHEN I interact with elements THEN the system SHALL show Pratika's brand colors for all interactive states
3. WHEN I switch between light and dark themes THEN the system SHALL use appropriate Pratika brand colors for both modes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see Pratika's typography (Merriweather for titles, Open Sans for body text), so that the text reflects Pratika's brand personality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view headings and titles THEN the system SHALL display them using Merriweather font family
2. WHEN I view body text and paragraphs THEN the system SHALL display them using Open Sans font family
3. WHEN I view the documentation THEN the system SHALL apply Pratika's typography consistently throughout Starlight pages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see Pratika's logo displayed appropriately, so that I can immediately identify the brand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the site with light backgrounds THEN the system SHALL display the white background logo variant
2. WHEN I view the site with dark backgrounds THEN the system SHALL display the dark blue background logo variant
3. WHEN I view the documentation section THEN the system SHALL display the appropriate logo variant in the Starlight sidebar

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the brand implementation to follow the project's established patterns, so that the implementation is maintainable and follows the template's architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing brand colors THEN the system SHALL use the existing Tailwind CSS @theme token structure in global.css
2. WHEN replacing colors THEN the system SHALL create dedicated brand color tokens without overriding Tailwind default palettes
3. WHEN updating Starlight documentation theme THEN the system SHALL replace the theme's color variables with Pratika's brand colors
4. WHEN implementing typography THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS font utilities and custom CSS variables
5. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing color scale structure (50-900) for consistency
