# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive component showcase page that displays all available UI components in the project. The showcase will help developers quickly discover and understand what components are available for building new pages, making the development process more efficient by providing visual examples and usage patterns for each component.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see all available UI components in one place, so that I can quickly discover what components exist in the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the component showcase page THEN the system SHALL display all available components organized by category
2. WHEN I view the showcase THEN the system SHALL show components from the following categories: avatars, banners, blocks, buttons, cards, feedback, forms, icons, links, and stars
3. WHEN I view each category THEN the system SHALL display the category name as a clear section header
4. WHEN I view the showcase THEN the system SHALL render actual component instances with realistic sample data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see visual examples of each component, so that I can understand how they look and behave before using them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a component in the showcase THEN the system SHALL render the component with appropriate sample props and content
2. WHEN I view interactive components THEN the system SHALL display them in their default state with any necessary client-side functionality enabled
3. WHEN I view components with variants THEN the system SHALL show multiple examples demonstrating different states or configurations
4. WHEN I view the showcase THEN the system SHALL ensure all components are properly styled and responsive

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the component names and file paths, so that I can easily locate and import the components I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view each component example THEN the system SHALL display the component name clearly
2. WHEN I view each component example THEN the system SHALL show the file path relative to the src/components directory
3. WHEN I view component information THEN the system SHALL format the file path in a way that makes it easy to copy for imports
4. WHEN I view the showcase THEN the system SHALL organize components in a logical hierarchy that matches the file structure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the showcase page to be easily accessible, so that I can quickly reference it during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to access the showcase THEN the system SHALL provide the page at a clear URL path like /components
2. WHEN I view the showcase page THEN the system SHALL use the existing MainLayout for consistency with the rest of the site
3. WHEN I navigate to the showcase THEN the system SHALL load quickly without unnecessary dependencies
4. WHEN I view the showcase on different devices THEN the system SHALL display properly on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see section-level components separately from UI components, so that I can understand the difference between page sections and reusable UI elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the showcase THEN the system SHALL separate section components (from src/components/sections) from UI components (from src/components/ui)
2. WHEN I view section components THEN the system SHALL display them in a dedicated section with appropriate spacing
3. WHEN I view section components THEN the system SHALL show examples from categories like features, landing, navbar&footer, pricing, testimonials, and misc
4. WHEN I view large section components THEN the system SHALL ensure they display properly without breaking the page layout
