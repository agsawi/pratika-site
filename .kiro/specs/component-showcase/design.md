# Design Document

## Overview

The Component Showcase feature will create a dedicated page that displays all available UI and section components in the project. This page will serve as a visual catalog for developers, helping them discover and understand the available components before implementing them in their projects.

The showcase will be implemented as a standalone static Astro page that follows the project's established patterns and uses the existing MainLayout for consistency. This implementation will not modify any existing code or components - it will only import and display them with sample data. The page will organize components by category and display them with realistic sample data to demonstrate their appearance and functionality.

## Architecture

### Page Structure
The component showcase will be implemented as a single Astro page located at `src/pages/components.astro`. This follows Astro's file-based routing convention, making the page accessible at `/components`.

### Component Organization
Components will be organized into two main sections:

1. **UI Components** - Located in `src/components/ui/`
   - Avatars (4 components)
   - Banners (1 component)
   - Blocks (11 components)
   - Buttons (9 components)
   - Cards (6 components)
   - Feedback (1 component)
   - Forms (9 components + input components)
   - Icons (Icon component + icon definitions)
   - Links (3 components)
   - Stars (2 components)

2. **Section Components** - Located in `src/components/sections/`
   - Features (4 components)
   - Landing (3 components)
   - Navbar & Footer (3 components)
   - Pricing (1 component)
   - Testimonials (3 components)
   - Misc (3 components)

### Layout Integration
The showcase page will use the existing `MainLayout.astro` to maintain consistency with the rest of the site. This ensures proper navigation, footer, theming, and responsive behavior.

## Components and Interfaces

### Showcase Page Component
```astro
---
// src/pages/components.astro
import MainLayout from "@/layouts/MainLayout.astro";
// Import all UI components
// Import all section components
// Import sample data
---

<MainLayout title="Component Showcase | ScrewFast">
  <!-- UI Components Section -->
  <!-- Section Components Section -->
</MainLayout>
```

### Component Display Structure
Each component will be displayed with:
- **Component Name**: Clear heading showing the component name
- **File Path**: Relative path from `src/components/` for easy import reference
- **Live Example**: Rendered component with appropriate sample props
- **Category Grouping**: Components organized by their directory structure

### Sample Data Management
Sample data will be defined within the showcase page to provide realistic examples:
- Avatar URLs for avatar components
- Sample text content for cards and blocks
- Form field examples for form components
- Icon names for icon demonstrations
- Realistic props for section components

## Data Models

### Component Category Structure
```typescript
interface ComponentCategory {
  name: string;
  path: string;
  components: ComponentItem[];
}

interface ComponentItem {
  name: string;
  filePath: string;
  component: AstroComponent;
  sampleProps?: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### Sample Data Objects
```typescript
// Avatar sample data
const avatarSamples = [
  "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1568602471122-7832951cc4c5...",
  // Additional avatar URLs
];

// Text samples for various components
const sampleContent = {
  title: "Sample Component Title",
  description: "This is a sample description for demonstration purposes.",
  // Additional sample content
};
```

## Error Handling

### Component Loading
- **Graceful Degradation**: If a component fails to render, display an error message instead of breaking the entire page
- **Missing Props**: Provide sensible defaults for all component props to prevent rendering errors
- **Image Loading**: Use placeholder images or handle missing image URLs gracefully

### Responsive Behavior
- **Mobile Layout**: Ensure components display properly on mobile devices with appropriate spacing
- **Large Components**: Handle section components that might be too wide by providing appropriate containers
- **Overflow Management**: Prevent horizontal scrolling issues with proper CSS containment

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy Loading**: Consider lazy loading for components that are below the fold
- **Image Optimization**: Use optimized images for sample data
- **Bundle Size**: Import only necessary components to avoid bloating the page

## Testing Strategy

### Visual Testing
1. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Test the showcase page across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. **Responsive Design**: Verify proper display on mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes
3. **Dark/Light Mode**: Ensure all components display correctly in both theme modes
4. **Component Rendering**: Verify each component renders with sample data without errors

### Functional Testing
1. **Navigation**: Confirm the page is accessible via `/components` URL
2. **Layout Consistency**: Verify the page uses MainLayout and maintains site consistency
3. **Interactive Components**: Test that interactive components (buttons, forms) function properly
4. **Performance**: Ensure the page loads within acceptable time limits

### Content Validation
1. **Component Coverage**: Verify all UI and section components are included
2. **File Path Accuracy**: Confirm all displayed file paths are correct and up-to-date
3. **Sample Data Quality**: Ensure sample data is realistic and demonstrates component capabilities
4. **Category Organization**: Verify components are properly categorized and organized

### Integration Testing
1. **MainLayout Integration**: Confirm proper integration with the existing layout system
2. **Theme System**: Test integration with the project's theming system
3. **Routing**: Verify the page integrates properly with Astro's routing system
4. **Build Process**: Ensure the page builds correctly in production mode
